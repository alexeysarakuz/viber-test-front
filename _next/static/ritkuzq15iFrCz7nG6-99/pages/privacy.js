Legitimate interests are generally of a legal or commercial nature and refer to instances in which Tastewise has a vital interest that could not be achieved other than by using personal data (e.g., conducting aggregate analyses for business and commercial purposes, using Publicly Available Data, performing statistical analyses, initiating legal proceedings, security reasons ). In the context of processing Publicly Available Data, it is Tastewise\u2019s legitimate interest to process such data for statistical purposes that support and inform its trend and volume analysis services and products, given that such Publicly Available Data is processed in accordance with the provisions of Article 89 of the GDPR and as set forth in this statement. The foregoing is also in line with the Article 29 Working Party Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, which explicitly articulates that processing for statistical purposes, including in commercial context, would be considered legitimate interest of the controller. It is Tastewise\u2019s position that, in line with the above mentioned Opinion, the legitimate interest in processing such Publicly Available Data is not overridden by the rights of the data subject, mainly due to the fact that the processing of such Publicly Available Data is trivial and that Influencer Data, which is publicly available, trivial and published by the individual in a business context, and both do not involve automated decision-making, including profiling, and does not pose significant risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. This is also supported by the fact that such Publicly Available Data and Influencer Data are, evidently, made publicly available by the data subjects themselves and are available for review by any internet user. Therefore, subject to the safeguards applied to such Publicly Available Data, Tastewise bases its use of such Publicly Available Data, to the extent that the underlying datasets include any Personal Data, on its Legitimate Interest.
