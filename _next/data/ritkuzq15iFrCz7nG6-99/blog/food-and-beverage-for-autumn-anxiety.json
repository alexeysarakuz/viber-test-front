With kids on their way back to school (or school Zoom), we’ve reached the time of the “end-of-summer blues” - that infamous time of low energy and high anxiety. 2020 has thrown a lot at us - but summer functional foods are here to save the day. \n\n\n\nWhat is a ‘functional food’? An ingredient or dish that provides value beyond sating hunger or basic nutritional needs; think ginger ale for a stomach ache, or turmeric for immunity. Functional foods are on the rise generally (50% of all conversations about food mention their functionality!), and consumers are turning towards food and beverage for that extra dose of late-summer soothe. \n\n\n\n> Want to read our June, 2020 report on functional foods? Download it for free, **[here](https://reports.tastewise.io/functional-foods-revisited)**.\n\nPopular interest in food and beverage to relieve anxiety is up 65% more than last year, while foods that provide general comfort are up 61% in popularity YoY. Immunity, the primary motivation behind functional foods for months at the start of the pandemic, has taken a nosedive - consumers are 5x less interested in immunity now than they were in April/May, and interested in immunity took a -12% hit between June and July. As consumers have settled into a pandemic mindset and the threat of coronavirus is no longer new, anxiety-relief is now top-of-mind. It’s a great reminder that what was true at the start of the pandemic is no longer - and the food and beverage industry needs to adapt to this fast-changing “new normal”. \n\n\n\n**If everyone's stressed, what can food & beverage brands do about it?** \n\nHow can food and beverage brands meet their stressed out consumers’ needs most effectively? By understanding which ingredients, dishes, and drinks consumers turn to this month for relief. Here are a few insights into the food that combat consumers’ August anxiety. \n\n\n\n- **Bitters:** Up 63% YoY in consumer use at home for curbing anxiety; consider offering cocktails that feature anxiety-reducing ingredients. \n\n\n- **Squash:** Up 46% YoY in at-home consumer use for anxiety relief; summer is squash season, and consumers are enjoying getting outside to farmers markets. What products could pair well with a locally-sourced squash soup? Bonus: consumer interest in squash for anxiety is up 605% YoY at restaurants and farmers markets - keep your finger on the pulse of this trend in the final weeks of summer. \n\n\n- **Mint:** the summer herb is up 45% YoY in consumer use at home. The leaves are incredibly versatile across dishes, and pair well with other functional ingredients in drinks. Anxiety-busting grapefruit and mint spritzer, anyone? \n\n\n- **Tea:** the cozy beverage is up 25% YoY in at-home use for anti-anxiety needs, yet is down 24% YoY at restaurants. Tea is likely a better fit for at home use, due to home-bound routines, the impracticality of delivery, and the times of day for use (tea is up 58% YoY as an after dinner drink, and has seen sharp increase in popularity since the start of the pandemic) . \n\n\n- **Seltzer:** The bubbly drink is up 28% YoY in at-home use, and 252% at restaurants, for anxiety relief. Last year’s alcoholic seltzer trend quickly came to stay; this summer sees the refreshing qualities of seltzer combine with functional ingredients to kick anxiety to the curb.
