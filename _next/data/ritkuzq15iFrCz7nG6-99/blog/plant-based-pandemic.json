The trend, worth $42B, is here to stay, and the food and beverage industry is adapting to its unique demands. \n\n\n\nWe combed the plant-based landscape for today’s biggest trends in our latest report. Read on for a look at our findings, then get the full report at the link below.\n\n\n\n[**DOWNLOAD THE FREE REPORT**](https://reports.tastewise.io/plant-based)\n\n\n\nPlant-based is the second most discussed diet among American eaters today, right after veganism. However, the category is seeing much higher growth than its vegan counterpart. So what distinguishes plant-based from vegan? To many, “vegan” feels ideologically intense. “Plant-based” provides a similar diet with greater flexibility.\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, consumers are drawn to plant-based eating for personal reasons - like health and wellness - rather than the global reasons (think sustainability, climate change) that drove the trend just a few months ago. This is reflective of a larger overall trend in the food and beverage space away from ideological motivations, and towards personal health. \n\n\n38% more restaurants serve dairy alternatives than meat alternatives - but that doesn’t necessarily mean that dairy alternatives are more popular amongst consumers. Both categories have equal penetration in consumer conversations about plant-based, and the growth rates are mismatched - in clear favor of one category. \n\n\nWant to learn more about where plant-based trends are heading in 2020 and beyond?
