In the best of times, most companies spend significant time and money on data and insight reports, both of which can fall short in providing up-to-date value. In 2020’s dynamism (aka the word everyone uses to mean: unpredictability, craziness, headache), trends are changing fast; one day, trends in home cooking are big news, the next it’s the rise of delivery, the next it’s something altogether different. Without real-time data, it’s a serious challenge to quantify these trends and understand their patterns.\n\n\n**In 2021, how can you evaluate today’s shifts in consumer behavior - with an eye towards tomorrow’s trends - in a more efficient way?**\n\n\nTo create an innovative flavor library ready for the tests of 2021, consider using 2020’s emerging trends as a case study. By evaluating the real-time data behind today’s trends, you’ll be able to put a process in place that is dependable, efficient, and built for sustainable growth.\n\n\nTracking trends as they happen is one thing - valuable, for sure - but being able to predict or anticipate trends is another. This ability isn’t a superpower; it’s vision granted by a **data-backed understanding of the motivations behind today’s trends.** Diverse consumer motivations, the diets, preferences, tastes, demands, textures, occasions and more that drive consumption, are at the root of every single choice that consumers make. What underpins today’s biggest trends? Why are, for example, pumpkin spice lattes popular year after year? \n\nAnecdotal “gut feelings”, no matter how well-reasoned, can’t drive sound internal decision-making or build long-term client trust. Data-driven insights into consumer behavior (on the order of a multi-million person focus group!), however, is another story. \n\nLet’s consider one of 2020’s most significant trends: **food and beverage for immunity.** Interest in immunity-boosting ingredients is up a significant 37% month-over-month; interest is still up +27% more than this time last year following the original massive spike in the trend at the start of the pandemic. Understanding the role immunity plays in emerging trends can help companies predict the ‘stickiness’ of those trends, and to what extent they will be significant in a 2021 shaped by the pandemic. \n\n[Download the eBook for Free](https://tastewise.io/download-report/flavor-innovation-ebook)\n\nHere’s a bite-sized look at how to amp up your flavor innovation process. \n\n**Step 1: The Why**\n\nTake a step back, and view your consumers’ behavior through the lens of why. What motivations are fundamental to the trends you are interested in exploring? For example: How does today’s established interest in health and wellness, a topic of interest for a full 13% of all food and beverage occasions, influence your category? This step can be applied on a macro level (ie. nationwide) or a more specific level (ie. moms in New York; vegans in Wales). \n\n**Step 2: The How**\n\nHow does the “why” play out in your consumers’ lives? Where do their demands and preferences surface in eating and drinking? For example - is vegan food and beverage in demand during breakfast? (Spoiler: yes. A full 12% of breakfast occasions involve vegan ingredients, the highest penetration for the category). Do moms looking for immunity-boosting ingredients rely on snacks? Narrow your focus to specific meal-times, categories, or preparations. \n\n**Step 3: The What** \n\nFinally, armed with the “why” and the “how”, it’s time for the “what”. What flavors most align with your consumers’ motivations and the ways they look to fulfill those needs in their daily lives? For example, vitamins, sickness treatments, and probiotics in food & beverage are becoming more and more top of mind for consumers each month -interest is up between 6-16% MoM for each of the categories. Which ingredients are most suited to those needs? If you already have flavors in hand, how can you energize your content marketing by explicitly targeting your consumers’ motivations? \n\n**Ready to build an innovative flavor library?** Hungry for more insights? \n\nOur latest ebook, The 2021 Flavor Innovation Guide, gives companies a roadmap to orient themselves in a changing food and beverage landscape.

Now, nearly a year later, the world has changed in unexpected ways. What has this meant for the functional food & beverage space, valued at $235B?\n\n \n\nFunctional foods are still very much top-of-mind for consumers. People want more from their food than to just feel full; everything from gut health to anxiety treatment to stress relief are on the table. Recipes that address functional needs are used 1.5x more by home cooks than those that do not: **it’s no wonder, then, that 50% of all conversations about food today mention the functional benefits of ingredients or dishes.** \n\n \n\nRead on for 3 bite-sized insights from our latest report on functional foods, and download the full report to understand how your brand can successfully plug into the trend. \n\n\n \n\n[**DOWNLOAD THE FREE REPORT**](https://reports.tastewise.io/functional-foods-revisited)\n\n \n\n\nToday, there is a 54% gap between supply and demand of functional food recipes for at-home cooks; people want functional benefits while cooking for themselves at home, and the current landscape falls short in meeting their needs. \n \n\nCOVID-19 has increased consumer awareness of medicinal foods; 2020’s mainstream consumer consciousness is more likely to turn to eastern medicine (ex. ayurvedic) ingredients for a health boost than previous years. \n \n\nConsumers want immediate relief – and are abandoning longer-term, goal-oriented motivations for eating functional foods. Internal health functions like ‘comfort’ (up +74% YoY among consumers) are steadily growing in popularity, while lifestyle goals like weight loss and fitness are losing steam. \n \n\nWith the right data-driven consumer insights, CPG and food service brands can address these consumers’ needs during a particularly stressful time.

From products and dishes, to their relationship with diets, functions and audience segments (and so much more!), our team uses a data-driven approach to evaluate everything related to trends. The following five criteria center on the questions our platform ‘asks’; our data scientists use these to create the reports you know and love on the industry’s latest food and beverage trends. \n\n\n- **Restaurant Buy-In:** Restaurant kitchens often signal contemporary culinary taste; something finding traction on restaurant menus can indicate that its popularity is likely to rise elsewhere. Are cutting-edge chefs, restaurants, and thought leaders taking advantage of the product and/or its qualities, indicating that the product is on the cusp of nationwide recognition?\n\n- **Consumer Buy-In:** Interest in a product can be gauged by how consumers talk about it online. Are consumers talking about the product’s ingredients, benefits or uses on social media, and are they engaging with these qualities at home, in restaurants, or both? Are people joining the conversation over time, and do we expect relevance in the long-term?\n\n- **Need**: Consumers make purchases to fulfill needs both specific to their situation and guided by societal trends. Does the product clearly address the macro and micro needs of its intended audience? Are the addressed needs big enough and continuing to grow?\n\n- **Audience Positioning:** The better a brand understands its audience, the more relevant and wide-reaching the product can be. Is a product or dish designed for a specific audience’s needs? Is it significant across audiences?\nThe 'Je Nes Se Quoi' : Data shows us a lot, but there is also an art to innovation. Does the design of the product and the experience of consuming it make it worthwhile, unique, and enjoyable to the consumer? Does the product offer something special to its category, or the market more broadly?\n\n**Ready to jump into your own trend evaluation?**\n\nCheck out our [report library](/resource-hub), then let us know when you are ready for your demo.","created_at":"2020-09-21T02:11:23.000Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T15:59:16.000Z","category":"Research","seo_url":null,"slug":"trend-makeup-with-tastewise","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_1_70271fe5c0.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/4_62709da893.png","published_at":"2020-09-21T02:11:23.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":175,"name":"data_science_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_data_science_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_data_science_tiny_ad23ee7ef4","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":41.47,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_data_science_tiny_ad23ee7ef4.png"}},"hash":"data_science_tiny_ad23ee7ef4","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":42,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/data_science_tiny_ad23ee7ef4.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T19:03:14.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T19:03:14.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":176,"name":"data_science_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_data_science_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_data_science_main_85f8a37cfe","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":45.13,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_data_science_main_85f8a37cfe.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_data_science_main.png","hash":"medium_data_science_main_85f8a37cfe","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":349.79,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_data_science_main_85f8a37cfe.png"},"small":{"name":"small_data_science_main.png","hash":"small_data_science_main_85f8a37cfe","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":166.35,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_data_science_main_85f8a37cfe.png"}},"hash":"data_science_main_85f8a37cfe","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":155.34,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/data_science_main_85f8a37cfe.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T19:03:15.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T19:03:15.000Z"}},{"id":24,"title":"5 Ingredients to Soothe the Autumn Blues","how_long_to_read":"2 min read","author":"Miriam Aniel","date":"2020-08-31T16:00:00.000Z","description":"Autumn is around the corner - where has the time gone?

With kids on their way back to school (or school Zoom), we’ve reached the time of the “end-of-summer blues” - that infamous time of low energy and high anxiety. 2020 has thrown a lot at us - but summer functional foods are here to save the day. \n\n\n\nWhat is a ‘functional food’? An ingredient or dish that provides value beyond sating hunger or basic nutritional needs; think ginger ale for a stomach ache, or turmeric for immunity. Functional foods are on the rise generally (50% of all conversations about food mention their functionality!), and consumers are turning towards food and beverage for that extra dose of late-summer soothe. \n\n\n\n> Want to read our June, 2020 report on functional foods? Download it for free, **[here](https://reports.tastewise.io/functional-foods-revisited)**.\n\nPopular interest in food and beverage to relieve anxiety is up 65% more than last year, while foods that provide general comfort are up 61% in popularity YoY. Immunity, the primary motivation behind functional foods for months at the start of the pandemic, has taken a nosedive - consumers are 5x less interested in immunity now than they were in April/May, and interested in immunity took a -12% hit between June and July. As consumers have settled into a pandemic mindset and the threat of coronavirus is no longer new, anxiety-relief is now top-of-mind. It’s a great reminder that what was true at the start of the pandemic is no longer - and the food and beverage industry needs to adapt to this fast-changing “new normal”. \n\n\n\n**If everyone's stressed, what can food & beverage brands do about it?** \n\nHow can food and beverage brands meet their stressed out consumers’ needs most effectively? By understanding which ingredients, dishes, and drinks consumers turn to this month for relief. Here are a few insights into the food that combat consumers’ August anxiety. \n\n\n\n- **Bitters:** Up 63% YoY in consumer use at home for curbing anxiety; consider offering cocktails that feature anxiety-reducing ingredients. \n\n\n- **Squash:** Up 46% YoY in at-home consumer use for anxiety relief; summer is squash season, and consumers are enjoying getting outside to farmers markets. What products could pair well with a locally-sourced squash soup? Bonus: consumer interest in squash for anxiety is up 605% YoY at restaurants and farmers markets - keep your finger on the pulse of this trend in the final weeks of summer. \n\n\n- **Mint:** the summer herb is up 45% YoY in consumer use at home. The leaves are incredibly versatile across dishes, and pair well with other functional ingredients in drinks. Anxiety-busting grapefruit and mint spritzer, anyone? \n\n\n- **Tea:** the cozy beverage is up 25% YoY in at-home use for anti-anxiety needs, yet is down 24% YoY at restaurants. Tea is likely a better fit for at home use, due to home-bound routines, the impracticality of delivery, and the times of day for use (tea is up 58% YoY as an after dinner drink, and has seen sharp increase in popularity since the start of the pandemic) . \n\n\n- **Seltzer:** The bubbly drink is up 28% YoY in at-home use, and 252% at restaurants, for anxiety relief. Last year’s alcoholic seltzer trend quickly came to stay; this summer sees the refreshing qualities of seltzer combine with functional ingredients to kick anxiety to the curb.  \n\n\n\n","created_at":"2020-09-21T02:05:02.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:49:41.000Z","category":"Research","seo_url":null,"slug":"food-and-beverage-for-autumn-anxiety","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/automn_blues_cover_c963ae557a.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/automn_blues_ec45e086e1.png","published_at":"2020-09-21T02:05:02.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":114,"name":"Autumn_blues_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Autumn_blues_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_Autumn_blues_tiny_3de21ee253","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":45.49,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Autumn_blues_tiny_3de21ee253.png"}},"hash":"Autumn_blues_tiny_3de21ee253","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":44.5,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Autumn_blues_tiny_3de21ee253.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:52.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:52.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":117,"name":"Autumn_blues_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Autumn_blues_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":55.36,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Autumn_blues_main.png","hash":"medium_Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":442.32,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Autumn_blues_main.png","hash":"small_Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":205.75,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787.png"}},"hash":"Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":204.41,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Autumn_blues_main_ab33b38787.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:53.000Z"}},{"id":23,"title":"Growth Hacking: The Power Tool for F&B Innovation","how_long_to_read":"5 min","author":"Miriam Aniel","date":"2020-08-10T16:00:00.000Z","description":"“Growth hacking”. If you aren’t a tech person (or even if you are), the term might make you cringe. Hacking growth? Isn’t that just a buzzword for yuppie Silicon Valley nerds in hoodies? Nope - In 2020, it's the power tool the food and beverage industry needs. Read on for more. ","content":"## Growth Hacking and the Food and Beverage Industry\n\n“Growth hacking”. If you aren’t a tech person (or even if you are), the term might make you cringe. Hacking growth? Isn’t that a buzzword for yuppie Silicon Valley nerds in hoodies? Why is a food and beverage intelligence company like Tastewise talking about a term usually relegated to the world of software?  \n\n\n\nThe good news: “Hacking” doesn’t require any developer skills, instead demanding a dedication to innovation, pushing boundaries, flexibility, and adaptation to the market’s peaks and valleys. In a changing food and beverage market with its own share of valleys, such a solution is valuable. We at Tastewise are talking about growth hacking in the food and beverage space because we think it can change everything - and we don’t say that lightly. \n\n\n\n## What is growth hacking?\nA decade ago, Sean Ellis - a successful entrepreneur and angel investor - was faced with a new challenge: how does one describe a job that was built to lie outside of conventional categories and descriptors? At the time, Ellis had grown his company significantly without relying on traditional marketing or sales strategies. When looking for his replacement, the usual categories couldn’t describe the kind of experience he was looking for. Marketers, often hindered by budget, didn’t exactly fit the bill; Ellis wanted someone for whom growth was the sole goal -- not messaging, not content creation, not sales -- and could do it in the most bootstrapping, creative ways possible. From there, the idea of \"growth hacking\" was born: the process of accelerating growth for your company by the most innovative means possible. \n\n\n\n> “A growth hacker is a person whose true north is growth.” Sean Ellis\n\n\n\nAll of this focus on growth makes sense. For startups, growth is the primary metric of success; if a startup isn’t measurably and consistently growing, they’re heading in the exact wrong direction. Creating room for someone to shepherd that growth from A - Z can be critical for companies with limited resources and time in a competitive market. And the proof has been in the pudding - many companies that have adopted growth hacking strategies have seen significant changes to their performance. \n\n\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the food and beverage industry? Not everyone is a startup, and putting one’s eggs in a basket with a concept that seems deliberately alternative can feel like a big risk -- especially when a lot of money is at stake.\n\n\n\nHere’s the secret: growth hacking is not only relevant to the food and beverage industry of 2020, it’s essential. \n\n\n\n## Conventional Strategies are Now Dead Weight\n\n\n\nNo one in the food and beverage industry is doing the same thing they were doing in February of this year. You don’t need to hear it again - things are different, and they will continue to be different moving forward. The way people buy, cook, and eat is changing day-to-day. Conventional analytics strategies like surveys and retail focus groups were already on their way out within the last two years; the advent of the global pandemic was the nail in the coffin for the old ways of understanding the market. \n\n\n\nIn this new world, what is left for the food and beverage companies who have managed to survive thus far? How can growth again become top-of-mind, Ellis’ “north star” in an environment that challenges everything that once was the norm? \n\n\n\nHere’s where growth hacking comes into play, and it starts with taking stock of exactly what is needed to drive growth. In today’s market, this reflection isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity. Ask yourself: What is missing from your knowledge base? Do you need to know how your consumers are using your product - and do you need to know it right now? What will the next delivery trend will look like? What pairings with your product are trending? What draws people to eat what they do, and how does this redefine the industry? \n\n> What is missing from your knowledge base?\n\n\nTo incorporate growth hacking into company strategy doesn’t require a new hire or job title; all it takes is a dedicated focus on growth, and a willingness to step outside of traditional strategies and towards innovative, inexpensive-yet-high-yield analytic solutions.\n\n\n\nThere are a million questions that require the best methods, tools and practices to answer. Going bigger with surveys or focus groups won’t fix the problem; with less than half of every dollar being spent on retail even before COVID-19, a retail focus group isn’t the solution. Finding an adaptive tool that can uncover the right information for your needs outpaces any value of the information drawn from outdated sources. These solutions require a specificity to the industry; growth hacking can’t be a ‘one size fits all’ solution to the specific challenges facing industry stakeholders. \n\n\n\n## Tastewise: the F&B Growth Hacker (No Basement Required)\n\n\n\nIf you’re with us to this point, you have a sense of what growth hacking can offer.

However, the category is seeing much higher growth than its vegan counterpart. So what distinguishes plant-based from vegan? To many, “vegan” feels ideologically intense. “Plant-based” provides a similar diet with greater flexibility.\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, consumers are drawn to plant-based eating for personal reasons - like health and wellness - rather than the global reasons (think sustainability, climate change) that drove the trend just a few months ago. This is reflective of a larger overall trend in the food and beverage space away from ideological motivations, and towards personal health. \n\n\n38% more restaurants serve dairy alternatives than meat alternatives - but that doesn’t necessarily mean that dairy alternatives are more popular amongst consumers. Both categories have equal penetration in consumer conversations about plant-based, and the growth rates are mismatched - in clear favor of one category. \n\n\nWant to learn more about where plant-based trends are heading in 2020 and beyond?

Innovative food service and CPG players have created a new trend to watch: **cocktail kits.** \n\n\n\nWith meal kits well-established in the arena (and growing: meal kits are up +511% in popularity), cocktail kits are the next big movers-and-shakers in the space.

The trend is far more than a temporary fad; it’s already +45% more popular than the previous star of the kit scene, bake-at-home pizza kits, and growing. \n \n\nSince March, we’ve seen an +816% growth in conversations about delivery from bars, but only 1.4% are currently offering cocktail kits; bars must consider the trend as a potentially lucrative part of their strategy during COVID-19. \n \n\nMargarita kits are up a whopping +4,561% in interest; Bloody Marys and Mimosas aren’t far behind. Local bars are adding their own spin to these staple drinks, and are offering artisanal versions highlighting local ingredients. \n \n\n**How can CPGs tap into a food-service heavy trend?** Consider innovative food pairings to match your demographic’s preferred cocktail. Lasagna and seafood are two of the trendiest cocktail pairings for at-home eaters and drinkers; what brings them to the table will surprise you. \n \n\nMarketing strategies will benefit from understanding what drives consumers to cocktail kits over time – in March 2020, ‘comfort’ is one of the driving motivations. \n \n\nCurious to learn more about this promising trend?

Virtual restaurants are stepping up the plate - read on for a look at the category's current impact. ","content":"**Virtual Restaurants in a Post-Pandemic World**\n\n\nIn the past five years, once stagnant consumer habits and behaviors began to change at an exponential rate – with no sign of slowing down. The most significant changes lay in the motivations behind consumer choices; the era of functional food arrived, and was firmly established in the mainstream by 2019.\n\n \n\nConsumer spending habits also experienced significant change. In 2017, consumers spent, for the first time ever, more money on restaurants than on groceries; the consumer landscape evolved once again as traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant dining began to cede to dine-out and order-in eating. \n\n \n\nThese changes set an important benchmark for the future of the industry. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\n\n \n\nToday’s food and beverage ecosystem is feeling the impact of current public health events across all areas. In-demand products are flying off the shelves as people prepare for the worst; weekly shopping lists now focus on the weeks and months ahead. Traditional buyer/supplier relationships have dried up, and farmers must make tough choices on how to manage product that no one is buying. From news reports on consumer behavior in food and beverage spaces, to cancelled trade shows, to community action around restaurant closures and layoffs, everyone from consumers to industry stakeholders have felt the squeeze and are preparing for the months to come. \n\n**The Rise of Delivery**\n\nIn the last five years, restaurant delivery increased a solid 20% in popularity, and is currently valued at $100B. As consumer spending began to leak away from supermarkets and toward restaurant dining, the delivery category picked up the momentum that would carry it to its current position: an independent, significant category in the food and beverage industry.\n\n \n\nWith these recent, fundamental changes in consumer behavior, a new opportunity for expanded growth presented itself: restaurants as a conduit for CPGs. Restaurants were well on their way to becoming critical for distribution and brand survival; some CPG companies were opening their own branded restaurant chains, and an entire ecosystem of branded restaurants was poised to emerge. CPGs began to follow the consumer spending transition away from big box stores. \n\n \n\nThat reality has now been complicated. \n\n \n\nIn addition the challenges of high rents, bad capex, unpredictable customer relationships and slow growth/scale in brick and mortar restaurants, CPGs, restaurateurs, and their investors now face different, pressing motivations to abandon brick and mortar storefronts entirely. \n\n \n\nWhen will physical restaurants even be able to reopen? What kind of investments will the economy allow?\n\n \n\nAt the end of 2019, smart food brands were choosing to invest in the newest concept, virtual restaurants, over brick and mortar locations. That choice has now become an urgent prospect that restaurants and brands must consider seriously in order to survive. \n\nVirtual restaurants (VRs), or ‘ghost kitchens’, are ‘dark kitchens’ that only sell on food delivery apps and have no storefront. VRs are more flexible, allowing several restaurant brands to operate from the same kitchen, maximizing revenues, increasing margins, and bolstering expansion possibilities. \n\nAs physical restaurant dining rooms are shuttered by health concerns and government mandates, use of delivery platforms has exploded. Consumer interest in delivery in the month of March alone skyrocketed 582%. Since March, that interest has skyrocketed a further 764% MoM, and has grown a jaw-dropping – yet unsurprising – 1,288% since this time last year.\n\n \n\nPremised on delivery, lower set-up costs (the average VR costs 25% less to set up than a traditional restaurant) and smaller operating budgets, VRs have become not only a clever tool acknowledged by some innovative brands, but a necessary adaptation for the survival of the hard-pressed restaurant market.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, CPGs must adapt to this new reality. The market has fractured wide-open to present a new, albeit complicated, opportunity for brands to position their products for a consumer audience with changing motivations, preferences, and behavior. \n\n**Virtual Restaurants: The Ghost of the Future**\n\nIn this evolving industry, companies need robust, real-time resources to make better-informed decisions — especially regarding VRs. At Tastewise, our AI discovers the gaps between demand and supply both at home and in restaurants, allowing brands and restaurateurs to open the right virtual restaurants with the right dishes on the menu for the right audience. \n\n \n\nWe’ve built an advanced AI platform that translates billions of social media posts, online recipes, and the largest database of restaurant menus (and more!) into analytics and actionable insights. Tastewise taps into this wealth of food and beverage information to unveil what is happening in a hyper-segmented world — down to a specific zip code, and all in real time. Our technology allows users to navigate data on the emerging consumer demands, tastes and motivations relevant to their particular needs, and crucial in today’s climate.\n\n \n\nThe current food and beverage landscape is murky. Traditional analytic strategies, on their way out of relevance before the world shut down, are now nearly obsolete; models like focus groups are near impossible, and surveys do not capture the dynamism of consumers’ lives, which change daily.\n\n \n\nConsumers are ready for new forms of eating and drinking experiences, and restaurants, brands, and others must be ready to provide for their needs.\n\nEnter the power of real-time data. \n\n \n\nIn our digitized world, social media, online recipes, delivery menus are more than ever before the proving ground for consumer behavior. With data that was previously unavailable and the technology to analyze it in real-time, Tastewise is at the forefront of industry innovation. \n\n \n\n**Are you considering moving towards virtual restaurants?** Let’s build your success together. \n\n \n\nGet in touch at info@tastewise.io","created_at":"2020-09-20T17:58:05.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:57:39.000Z","category":"Research","seo_url":null,"slug":"virtual-restaurants-where-are-they-headed","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_2_575b4be04a.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_3_a153ee0469.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T17:58:05.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":150,"name":"vr_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_vr_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_vr_tiny_8c90c18589","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":56.73,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_vr_tiny_8c90c18589.png"}},"hash":"vr_tiny_8c90c18589","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":55.54,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/vr_tiny_8c90c18589.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:06.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:06.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":156,"name":"VR_wave_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_VR_wave_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":89.5,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_VR_wave_main.png","hash":"medium_VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":759.53,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1.png"},"small":{"name":"small_VR_wave_main.png","hash":"small_VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":347.8,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1.png"}},"hash":"VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":261.55,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/VR_wave_main_0eed3d39a1.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:08.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:08.000Z"}},{"id":2,"title":"Responding to the Rise in Home Cooking","how_long_to_read":"2 Min Read","author":"Miriam Aniel","date":"2020-04-07T09:00:00.000Z","description":"28 million parents are looking for recipes to cook with their kids, but current offerings fall short of their needs.

While the last year has seen consumers increasingly turn to food and beverage for functional benefits, we’re seeing staggering growth in the trend while consumer routines are upended by coronavirus. Interest in immune-system supportive ingredients alone in the past month is up +66%, and we expect the trend to continue to rise.\n\nImmunity, stress relief, medicinal benefits and more are all skyrocketing; it is more important now than ever for food industry players to understand what solutions consumers look for in stressful times, and why. Read on for a look at the trends, then download the full spotlight below. \n\n \n\n[DOWNLOAD THE FREE REPORT](https://reports.tastewise.io/food-for-immunity-march-20-21)\n\n \n\n3 insights into health and wellness trends for March 2020: \n \n\n1. The top 3 ways consumers look to support their health right now through food and beverage? By focusing on ingredients that contain sickness treatment, stress relief, and immunity–boosting qualities.\n\n \n\nExample: Rosemary is up +114% since this time last year for “stress relief”. Understanding that consumers are looking for stress relief right now gives important insight into the mentality and behavior of your target audience.  \n\n \n\n2. Unexpected sources can provide big benefits in our current landscape. Melon and pickles are examples of food ingredients that are starting to show early trend signals for immunity-boosting motivations.\n\n \n\nAs consumers look for wellness, vitamin, antioxidant, and fermentation-rich ingredients can provide comfort in innovative ways.\n\n \n\n3. Beverages continue to be an important source of functional benefits for consumers looking to boost their health. We know kombucha has been on consumer radars for years as a gut-health drink; however, with the addition of medicinal ingredients like mushrooms, kombucha is showing a +73% YoY boom in consumer interest right now.\n\n \n\nWe see that consumers turn to what they know during times of crisis; chamomile, another familiar wellness drink, is up over 80% for anti-inflammatory benefits. \n\n \n\nWant to dig in to the data behind trending, health-focused ingredients? Tastewise harnesses billions of data points to provide a real-time understanding of the consumer motivations behind today’s most promising food trends.\n\n \n\n[DOWNLOAD THE FREE REPORT](https://reports.tastewise.io/food-for-immunity-march-20-21)\n","created_at":"2020-09-20T17:25:17.000Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T23:05:22.000Z","category":"Free Reports","seo_url":null,"slug":"food-for-immunity","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_15_8f5313b6bd.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/2_0d63189f5c.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T17:25:17.000Z","author_detailed":{"id":1,"name":"Ron Harnik","company":"VP Marketing, Tastewise","created_at":"2020-11-02T13:10:52.000Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T13:00:17.000Z","speaker_key":"ron-harnik","image":{"id":333,"name":"ron.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":400,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Innovative Flavor Library_.png","hash":"thumbnail_Innovative_Flavor_Library_2eb3f81cff","ext":".png","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":6.91,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Innovative_Flavor_Library_2eb3f81cff.png"}},"hash":"Innovative_Flavor_Library_2eb3f81cff","ext":".png","mime":"image/jpeg","size":30.56,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Innovative_Flavor_Library_2eb3f81cff.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-10-28T16:09:47.000Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T13:00:00.000Z"}},"preview":{"id":137,"name":"Immunity_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Immunity_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_Immunity_tiny_3e98006fe5","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":68.11,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Immunity_tiny_3e98006fe5.png"}},"hash":"Immunity_tiny_3e98006fe5","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":54.38,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Immunity_tiny_3e98006fe5.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:01.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:01.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":142,"name":"Immunity_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Immunity_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_Immunity_main_2f75b0950d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":84.31,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Immunity_main_2f75b0950d.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Immunity_main.png","hash":"medium_Immunity_main_2f75b0950d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":717.76,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_Immunity_main_2f75b0950d.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Immunity_main.png","hash":"small_Immunity_main_2f75b0950d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":329.53,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_Immunity_main_2f75b0950d.png"}},"hash":"Immunity_main_2f75b0950d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":261.34,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Immunity_main_2f75b0950d.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:03.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:03.000Z"}},{"id":5,"title":"Interest in Hard Seltzer – Fizzling Out, or Here to Stay?","how_long_to_read":"1 Min Read","author":"Miriam Aniel","date":"2020-03-05T10:00:00.000Z","description":"Hard seltzer was the drink of the summer in 2019, exploding in popularity across the United States.

Here are four observations from Tastewise’s AI platform on where the oat milk trend has been – and where it is headed. \n\n-----\n\n1. Oat milk isn’t just for vegans; consumers generally are excited about the ingredient, and the trend shows no sign of slowing down. Consumer interest increased +146% in the milk alternative over the last year, while restaurant use of oat milk increased 184%.\n\n2. The recently announced Oatly + Starbucks partnership makes a lot of sense; oat milk and coffee are the perfect pairing. Creamy, slightly sweet, and low fat, oat milk is making waves as the latest non-dairy milk trend in cafes and home refrigerators across the country. The ingredient’s qualities make it a great fit for indulgences as well: new ice cream and smoothie products crop up weekly, and brands and consumers alike understand that oat milk is a great start to the morning — or sweet treat enjoyed anytime.\n\n3. Oat milk makes a great canvas for delicious soups; soup recipes using the ingredient are generally increasing steadily in popularity. Dinner is also up in popularity as an occasion to use oat milk (+10% YoY).\n\n4. Savory, vegan dishes are the next frontier for oat milk. Pasta, spinach and garlic are all experiencing significant growth in home use when paired with the milk alternative. \n \n\n**Want to dig in to the data behind the oat milk trend?** Tastewise harnesses billions of data points to provide a real-time understanding of the consumer motivations behind today’s most promising food trends.\n\n[**DOWNLOAD THE FREE REPORT**](https://reports.tastewise.io/oat-milk-spotlight-feb-2020-0)","created_at":"2020-09-20T18:04:54.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:58:17.000Z","category":"Free Reports","seo_url":null,"slug":"oat-milk-spotlight","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_12_a8bf46fee7.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_281d7122b4.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T18:04:54.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":143,"name":"Oat_milk_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Oat_milk_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_Oat_milk_tiny_db3504f215","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":61.66,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Oat_milk_tiny_db3504f215.png"}},"hash":"Oat_milk_tiny_db3504f215","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":61.3,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Oat_milk_tiny_db3504f215.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:03.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:03.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":147,"name":"Oat_milk_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Oat_milk_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":71.98,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Oat_milk_main.png","hash":"medium_Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":588.65,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Oat_milk_main.png","hash":"small_Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":272.49,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956.png"}},"hash":"Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":244.63,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Oat_milk_main_d1f3961956.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:05.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:05.000Z"}},{"id":11,"title":"The Beyond Meat Boom","how_long_to_read":"1 Min Read","author":"Miriam Aniel","date":"2020-01-31T10:00:00.000Z","description":"Beyond Meat is everywhere: chances are, your local burger joint is already offering a vegan version of their most popular burger using the ingredient.

Our latest report, Food and Beverage Sustainability Trends in 2020, anticipates industry changes in sustainability for the upcoming year.\n\n \n\nFor companies looking to reduce their footprint, an accurate understanding of consumer preferences and demands is crucial. Over-production of undesired products contributes to damaging environmental practices; with the right information on today’s consumer choices, brands can put the right products on the right shelves — and keep them out of the landfill.\n\n \n\n[Food and Beverage Sustainability Trends in 2020](https://reports.tastewise.io/sustainability-report-2020-2) fine tunes the connection between the evidence-based claims for sustainability’s urgency – not least among which, in 2050, the world’s population will need 56% more food than today – and the general trend toward sustainability in the food and beverage industry. With consumer-specific insights, brands can strategize how best to participate in (and capitalize on!) this important moment in the industry.\n\n \n\nRead on for a sneak peek into our findings.\n\n---\n\n**Almost a quarter of consumers currently make sustainable F&B choices**\n\n23% more American consumers make food and beverage decisions based on sustainability considerations than a year ago. We expect this number to grow significantly in the coming months. \n \n**Consumers care about the planet, but care more about their health** \n\n“Health” is a dominating motivator for sustainable choices among consumers , but consumers are more likely to choose a sustainable option because its perceived health benefits over its environmental benefit. Despite the well-documented environmental damages of the animal agriculture industry, consumers are relatively apathetic to the planetary harm caused by the industry’s waste – currently, only 10% of consumer conversations about waste focuses on meat.\n\n**Packaging’s impact extends beyond just the environment**\n\nSustainably-minded packaging options – from to-go cups to take-away boxes and more – give restaurants a significant popularity advantage amongst consumers on social media. Restaurants that advertise their use of these products see a marked increase in consumer interest.\n\n**Sustainably produced ingredients will dominate tables and shelves**\n\nMainstream consumers are beginning to pay attention to not only the environmental consequence of a product after an item has been consumed (ie. wasteful plastic packaging), but also the environmental consequences of its production. Ingredients with sustainable and ethical supply chains will become more popular as consumers take a greater interest in products’ full lifecycles.\n \n\nHungry for more insights into how sustainability will affect your category and the industry at large in 2020? \n\n**[DOWNLOAD THE FREE REPORT](https://reports.tastewise.io/sustainability-report-2020-2)**\n","created_at":"2020-09-20T18:08:24.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:48:30.000Z","category":"Research","seo_url":null,"slug":"4-insights-into-2020s-sustainable-food-and-beverage-landscape","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_6_6b1a3d2599.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_1_20bef5027d.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T18:08:24.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":115,"name":"Beyond_meat_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Beyond_meat_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_Beyond_meat_tiny_dbfed3360c","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":54.71,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Beyond_meat_tiny_dbfed3360c.png"}},"hash":"Beyond_meat_tiny_dbfed3360c","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":55.9,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Beyond_meat_tiny_dbfed3360c.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:52.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:52.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":157,"name":"Sustainability_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Sustainability_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":61.42,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Sustainability_main.png","hash":"medium_Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":500.35,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Sustainability_main.png","hash":"small_Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":232.03,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf.png"}},"hash":"Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":254.5,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Sustainability_main_512cbb51cf.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:08.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:08.000Z"}},{"id":18,"title":"Tastewise’s Top Food and Beverage Predictions for 2020","how_long_to_read":"3 Min Read","author":"Miriam Aniel","date":"2019-11-19T10:00:00.000Z","description":"2019 was the year of niche eating: vegans looking for meat?

","content":"**Tastewise’s Top Food and Beverage Predictions for 2020**\n\n2019 was the year of niche eating: vegans looking for meat? Beyond Meat has it handled. The perfect remedy for an upset stomach? Look no further than the refrigerator. The last year of the decade saw the firm establishment of functional eating in the consumer consciousness, creating new opportunities for foods to get to work. In 2019, meat-centric diets rose in popularity, alongside CBD and carbonated beverages. What’s next in 2020? Read on for a look at which cuisines, diets, and ingredients-with-a-twist we predict to shine in the new year.\n\n\n**Diets**\n\n*Sugar-free; Intermittent Fasting*\n\n \n\nThe health-conscious Ketogenic diet skyrocketed in 2019; in 2020, we expect to see the continued evolution of other functional diets, with sugar-free eating and intermittent fasting on track to become the year’s big diet trends. Sugar-free eating has already risen 23% in mentions since last fall; its emergence is associated with new and continued product developments in sugar replacements, and further growth is anticipated in both categories. \n\n \n\nIntermittent fasting has attracted a vocal following over the past year: celebrities such as Beyonce and J-Lo take advantage of intermittent fasting’s purported benefits and people are noticing, with consumer mentions of intermittent fasting up 57% over the past year. \n\n \n\n**Global Cuisines**\n\n*Moroccan; Nigerian; Ethiopian; Senegalese; South African*\n\n \n\n71% of consumers have sampled diverse foods from around the world, mentioning their experience eating a global cuisine at least once online. Mediterranean and Vietnamese cuisines reached peak interest among general audiences in 2019, while Carribbean cuisines — up 32% in social mentions YoY — and African cuisines sparked new interest and experienced significant initial growth. \n\n \n\nThe large category of African cuisines saw an initial 9% growth as social mentions begin to take off; we expect increased popularity in 2020 around Moroccan, Nigerian, Ethiopian, Senegalese and South-African cuisines. \n\n \n\n**Functional Eating**\n\n*Gut health; Skincare* \n\n \n\nTastewise’s Functional Foods Report shows that 37% of America’s eaters and drinkers are looking for more functional value from their food. In 2019, consumers focused on stress relief and weight loss functions in their diets; skincare and gut health are the predicted functional wellness stars of 2020. \n\n \n\nThe quest for skincare functionality rose by 42% over the past year and is expected to keep growing in 2020. Similarly, gut health consideration has risen by 29% over the last 12 months. Though it has already seen significant growth in 2019, gut health is expected to make its breakthrough in 2020.\n\n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n*Fermented Foods; Plant-based Protein; Jackfruit* \n\n \n\nThe evolution of consumer gut health needs can be seen through the rise of fermented foods. This category rose 26% in 2019, as customers turned toward kombucha, kimchi, and sourdough to serve gut health.\n\n \n\nPlant-based foods were also in demand; as brands like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods led the category with new, vegan offerings, we saw a rising interest in plant proteins. Pea protein rose 13% over the last year and use of the protein is expected to grow even further in 2020. We expect protein-packed jackfruit to emerge as a mega-trend in 2020: with a significant drop in price, availability of the fruit across the US has grown alongside an 18% rise in social conversations.\n\n \n\n**Beverages**\n\n*Mocktails; Alcoholic Kombucha*\n\n \n\nThe beverage industry has become a creative playground, rich with innovative beverage offerings from established and newcomer brands alike. Seltzer, the star of summer 2019, signaled the rise of consumer interest in ‘leaner’ drinks, devoid of sugary additions. We predict alkaline water to be a significant beverage trend in 2020, as the drink has already risen 72% since last year.\n\n \n\nThe ‘mocktail’, the cocktail’s non-alcoholic sister, is growing in popularity — 2019 saw a 37% rise in social conversations as consumers look for better non-alcoholic options. For those inclined toward alcoholic beverages, a twist on popular kombucha is available; alcoholic kombucha has risen by 65% YoY and is expected to continue making noise in 2020.\n","created_at":"2020-09-20T18:20:56.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T19:02:19.000Z","category":"Research","seo_url":null,"slug":"tastewises-top-food-and-beverage-predictions-for-2020","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_7_ce442844d4.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/12_59dcd51e5a.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T18:20:56.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":125,"name":"FB_bev_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_FB_bev_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_FB_bev_tiny_0dd88b01c1","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":64.28,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_FB_bev_tiny_0dd88b01c1.png"}},"hash":"FB_bev_tiny_0dd88b01c1","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":50.82,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/FB_bev_tiny_0dd88b01c1.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:56.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:56.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":128,"name":"FB_bev_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_FB_bev_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_FB_bev_main_869facab79","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":81.46,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_FB_bev_main_869facab79.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_FB_bev_main.png","hash":"medium_FB_bev_main_869facab79","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":666.38,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_FB_bev_main_869facab79.png"},"small":{"name":"small_FB_bev_main.png","hash":"small_FB_bev_main_869facab79","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":308.08,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_FB_bev_main_869facab79.png"}},"hash":"FB_bev_main_869facab79","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":210.46,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/FB_bev_main_869facab79.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:57.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:58.000Z"}},{"id":16,"title":"Hot in Hotels: 3 Food & Bev Trends Hitting Hospitality","how_long_to_read":"2 Min Read","author":"Meirav Perelmutter","date":"2019-09-28T09:00:00.000Z","description":"From communal dining for working guests, to hotel restaurants designed to meet local demand, read on for a look at some of the newest F&B innovations in hospitality.\n","content":"#Hot in Hotels: 3 Food & Bev Trends Hitting Hospitality\n\n\n**Data-Driven customer insights: Creating F&B experiences for guests and locals alike**\n\nTravelers want hotels to be more than just a home base to which to return after a long day out. Mid-range hotels are breaking away from cookie-cutter vibes, instead telling a story specific to their location by offering thoughtful, local cuisine. These culinary choices, developed with data-driven consumer insights that shed light and popular tastes and diets, are designed to attract local customers and hotel guests alike. See how Tastewise generates location-based real-time culinary insights for hotels, virtual restaurants, and food halls.\n\n \n\n \n\n**Communal Areas: Co-working spaces at hotels offer much more than shared desks**\n\nCommunal areas at hotels, like in-demand co-working spaces, are transitioning to provide more comfortable eating experiences for those ordering delivery: modular seating allows for flexibility and impromptu group meals, ubiquitous power outlets and wifi keep workers powered through lunch, common access microwaves allow meals to be reheated and trays embedded in furniture let time-crunched visitors eat and move on. Some hotels offer partnerships with delivery platforms like Seamless and Grubhub, making ordering in easier than ever. \n\n \n\n**Luxury Pop-ups: When the closest convenience store is in-house**\n\nHotels are capitalizing on the retail success of pop-ups, opening gourmet mini-markets that cater to guests’ tastes twenty-four hours a day. While the concept of ‘grab-and-go’ food and beverage stations in hotels is nothing new, pairing convenience with an exciting brand collaboration can be. As pop-ups become more popular, hotels use mini retail spaces for more than just convenient eating, showcasing locally-made items alongside luxury or gourmet goods. Thoughtful design leaves visitors feeling like the experience has been curated with their days in mind. Easy convenience, meet luxury.

Read on for what you need to know right now about this emerging category. ","content":"**Ghost Stories - 4 Observations on the Virtual Restaurant Wave**\n\nVirtual restaurants essentially offer the benefits of ‘take-away’ ordering…without an actual restaurant from which to take the food away. In fact, a brick-and-mortar location plays little to no role in a virtual restaurant; virtual restaurants offer a menu that can solely be accessed for delivery, connecting customers directly to their order through online or app-based delivery platforms. Virtual restaurants are cheaper and more efficient than maintaining traditionally located restaurants, and are increasingly influential in today’s growing restaurant market. Ghost kitchens, as virtual restaurants are sometimes called, mark an important shift in how consumers are willing to relate to food and the experience of eating. Read on for four insights into what is making the virtual restaurant wave work. \n\n \n\n \n\n**Virtual restaurants are incredibly adaptable**\n\nThrough lower overhead costs and a delivery-only model, virtual restaurants are able to pivot quickly to address changing consumer tastes. Is there a new dessert that customers are rumored to love? Add a creative version of it to the menu. Did that hamburger topping fall flat? Take it off. Chefs in ghost kitchens are also able to experiment with new ingredients and dish concepts with less risk of fallout than those at traditional restaurants. Tastewise’s Food Trends Platform sheds light on the latest dishes that customers are craving. \n\n \n\n \n\n**Kitchen-only spaces mean cheaper real estate**\n\nGhost kitchens can cater to customers in busy, thriving neighborhoods, without paying the cost of rent to be located there. Virtual restaurants with expansive delivery options allow brands to rent kitchen space, often shared, in low-cost areas, slashing the costs of both the location and the support staff. No customers dining-in means no waiters, management, decor, bussers, etc. Delivery platforms also expose virtual restaurants to customer traffic in new ways; with menu and reviews outweighing location and atmosphere, virtual restaurant dishes are open to a wider audience.  \n\n \n\n \n\n**Multiple brands, menus and cuisines can come from just one kitchen**\n\nThe virtual restaurant concept does away with traditional space constrictions. Consider the following: Ghost kitchens can host multiple restaurant brands in one space; a brick-and-mortar restaurant can use its kitchen to host a virtual restaurant with a different menu and name; and virtual restaurant brand can offer different menus online to different neighborhoods – all from the same kitchen. Notable investors and restaurant groups are taking advantage of the various permutations that virtual restaurants offer, investing in restaurant brands that can only be accessed by the tap of an app. \n\n \n\n \n\n**Shared kitchen spaces are blossoming as sites of food production and experimentation**\n\nThe steady rise of virtual restaurants and new locations of food production are democratizing what it means to be a restaurateur.

According to Tastewise’s AI-powered food trend and analysis report, **over 37% of consumers are looking for functional benefits from their food;** with extensive educational information available online, we can expect consumer interest in functional foods to deepen over time. Read on for a look at three insights into consumer behavior that sustain the functional foods movement.\n\n \n\n**These days we want food to work for us in specific ways**\n\nGeneral wellness, while interesting to consumers, is not as significant as specific functions. Consumers are increasingly well-educated about their health and wellness needs, looking for ingredients that will support the specific functions that they need; they don’t want food to be just ‘healthy’, they want ingredients that will specifically support skin health, gut health, sleep health, etc. Consumers look for food items that will maintain health before it deteriorates, and those that will encourage recovery after illness. These desires have led to a booming industry: by 2025, the global functional foods market size is projected to reach more than $275 Billion.\n\n \n\n**Consumers are open to trying new things – just make sure they serve a purpose**\n\nIf an ingredient serves a specific, in-demand purpose, consumers are jumping in headfirst. Ingredients that sometimes don’t see particular growth amongst general consumers are seeing explosive growth amongst consumers interested in functional foods. Take moringa; in the past 12 months the plant has seen a 337% increase amongst consumers interested in improving focus, but only a 34% increase overall. With increased interest in functional eating and an expansion of the functional food market, functional ingredients are more likely to be the next popular foods among the general public. \n\n \n\n**Some popular ingredients work double duty**\n\nTwo ingredients hit the sweet spot of functionality, and are hard-working across multiple wellness categories: papaya and ashwagandha. Consumers are picking papaya when looking to improve focus (up 171% in the focus category over the last 12 months) and tackle anti-aging concerns (papaya together with anti-aging is up 154%). Ashwagandha, a plant commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine otherwise known as Indian ginseng, has become increasingly popular with consumers hoping to improve sleep quality (ashwagandha is up 51% with sleep) and relieve stress (up 67%).\n\n \n\nHungry for more insights?\n\n[**Download the full Functional Foods Report 2019 for free**](https://reports.tastewise.io/foodforfunction-0)\n","created_at":"2020-09-20T18:23:10.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:51:17.000Z","category":"Research","seo_url":null,"slug":"functional-foods-three-points-to-ponder","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_a11285556f.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_2_be5173ee45.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T18:23:10.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":129,"name":"Functional_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Functional_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_Functional_tiny_ff2e9a2a2d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":69.59,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Functional_tiny_ff2e9a2a2d.png"}},"hash":"Functional_tiny_ff2e9a2a2d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":65.04,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Functional_tiny_ff2e9a2a2d.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:58.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:58.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":131,"name":"Functional_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Functional_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_Functional_main_61e36869ce","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":79.48,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Functional_main_61e36869ce.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Functional_main.png","hash":"medium_Functional_main_61e36869ce","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":700.24,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_Functional_main_61e36869ce.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Functional_main.png","hash":"small_Functional_main_61e36869ce","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":316.12,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_Functional_main_61e36869ce.png"}},"hash":"Functional_main_61e36869ce","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":317.92,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Functional_main_61e36869ce.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:59.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:59.000Z"}},{"id":4,"title":"4 F&B Consumer Insights for Executives in 2019","how_long_to_read":"2 Min Read","author":"Meirav Perelmutter","date":"2019-02-05T10:00:00.000Z","description":"The rising popularity of bowls affords a new opportunity to showcase creative condiments; emerging ingredient tahini holds incredible untapped potential.

An enticing combination of versatility, ease, and aesthetic, the bowl hits the mark for what up-to-date consumers want. The rapid rise of bowls provides significant opportunities for restaurants, grocers, retailers and the CPG industry alike; bowls already hold 14% year over year growth, and are featured in menus of more than 12% of restaurants and counting. The dish offers the food industry a way to capture and own forward-thinking ideas, like the following.\n\n \n\n- The rising popularity of bowls affords a new opportunity to showcase creative condiments; emerging ingredient tahini holds incredible untapped potential.\nTahini is well-penetrated into online recipes with a 12% penetration rate, yet holds only -30% of the conversation. Featuring the condiment with in-demand bowls will get consumers talking about both.\n\n- Retailers and grocers can create ahead-of-the-game marketing plans tailored to the interests of a new potential consumer demographic: ‘only-bowlers’.\nOver 10% of bowl-makers don’t make anything but bowls at home; this ‘only-bowler’ demographic is over 20% more male and 3.5% more into fitness than other bowl-makers.\n\n - Freshness is top-of-mind for bowl consumers; marketing language centered on fresh ingredients and ‘clean eating’ aligns retailers with customers’ needs and wants.\n42% of bowl-eaters specifically call out the health benefits of bowls, and almost a fifth (19%) name fitness and ‘clean eating’ as a main priority when eating. Fresh versions of produce like black beans, corn, and cauliflower rice cater to consumers’ key needs for protein and clean eating.\n\n - Quality, gourmet pre-packaged CPGs foods can appeal to consumer preferences, enrich flavor profiles, and increase profits from bowls.\nSingle-use, packaged meats, cheeses and grains add valuable protein to meals and raise the flavor profile of dishes; the most popular ingredients across the meat, cheese and grain categories are chicken (8%), feta (3%) and quinoa (22%).\n\n","created_at":"2020-09-20T17:19:58.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:47:30.000Z","category":"Business ","seo_url":null,"slug":"4-fb-consumer-insights-for-executives-in-2019","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_a11285556f.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_2_be5173ee45.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T17:19:58.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":122,"name":"Consumer_insights_exec_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Consumer_insights_exec_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_Consumer_insights_exec_tiny_ce4c207f86","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":73.35,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Consumer_insights_exec_tiny_ce4c207f86.png"}},"hash":"Consumer_insights_exec_tiny_ce4c207f86","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":61.08,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Consumer_insights_exec_tiny_ce4c207f86.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:55.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:55.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":124,"name":"Consumer_insights_exec_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Consumer_insights_exec_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":86.41,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Consumer_insights_exec_main.png","hash":"medium_Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":763.1,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Consumer_insights_exec_main.png","hash":"small_Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":346.8,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020.png"}},"hash":"Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":268.58,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Consumer_insights_exec_main_361a864020.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:55.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:38:55.000Z"}},{"id":3,"title":"4 Insights into the ‘Meat Alternatives’ Market","how_long_to_read":"2 Min Read","author":"Meirav Perelmutter","date":"2019-02-01T10:00:00.000Z","description":"Meat alternatives are now much more than ‘fake meat’ — yes, they are vegan, but they evoke the real thing in creative, often uncompromising ways.

","content":"**4 Insights into the ‘Meat Alternatives’ Market**\n\nMeat alternatives are now much more than ‘fake meat’ — yes, they are vegan, but they evoke the real thing in creative, often uncompromising ways. Successful meat alternatives imitate the sensory experience of eating meat, giving consumers the texture and flavor they expect from the original. The category is experiencing substantial growth, yet our research shows that existing products often overlook the functional needs of a specific category of consumers. Read on for the insights that will give CPG executives, grocers and retailers a competitive advantage with these customers and more in a fast-moving market.\n\n \n\n1. The market lacks meat alternatives that are specifically positioned for fitness consumers.\nOpportunities abound for new, fitness-ready brands centered on low carb, high protein products. Plant-based foods already suit fit lifestyles; consumers use “fitness” as the 4th most common need for general plant-based products. “Fitness” currently ranks only 9th, however, when describing meat alternatives — even when they are plant-based.\n\n \n\n2. A consumer’s ‘vegan level’ is a key indicator of their needs, revealing 3 new distinct groups.\nExperimental, Moderate and Strict vegan levels indicate consumer tastes and dietary requirements in the meat alternatives category. “Clean eating” is only #45 in importance for Experimental Vegans but is a strong #10 for Moderate Vegans, indicating different priorities between the groups.\n\n \n\n3. Understanding consumer expectations from online data can shape the development and branding of new meat alternative products.\nConsumers expect certain qualities from existing meat alternatives. Real-time analysis show that ‘spicy’ and ‘sweet’ are trending among meat alternative consumers; Tastewise AI shows the context of each descriptor – sweet potato with burger, spicy black bean patty – and gives deeper insight into consumer experience and expectations of specific ingredients.\n\n \n\n4. Consumers look to established grocers, restaurants and retailers in the vegan food space for different, distinct needs.\nConsumers commonly describe Whole Foods as ‘organic’ (the #4 ranked descriptor), aligning with the grocer’s reputation. However, consumers describe vegan restaurant chain by Chloe. as ‘organic’ much less (#15), revealing unexpected consumer attitudes and experiences. Tastewise AI uses data to examine behaviors once only understood through intuition, helping businesses to better understand both consumers and retailers and create more focused strategies.\n\n","created_at":"2020-09-20T17:17:20.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:49:10.000Z","category":"Research","seo_url":null,"slug":"4-insights-into-the-meat-alternatives-market","preview_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_8_1a3e193ee6.png","article_image_link":"https://static.tastewise.io/uploads/Mask_Group_4_2096e32ecb.png","published_at":"2020-09-20T17:17:20.000Z","author_detailed":null,"preview":{"id":140,"name":"Meat_alternative_tiny.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":270,"height":270,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Meat_alternative_tiny.png","hash":"thumbnail_Meat_alternative_tiny_45398f22f4","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":65.33,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Meat_alternative_tiny_45398f22f4.png"}},"hash":"Meat_alternative_tiny_45398f22f4","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":54,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Meat_alternative_tiny_45398f22f4.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:02.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:02.000Z"},"Article_image":{"id":145,"name":"Meat_alternative_main.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":840,"height":400,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Meat_alternative_main.png","hash":"thumbnail_Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":117,"size":70.04,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/thumbnail_Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Meat_alternative_main.png","hash":"medium_Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":357,"size":577.05,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium_Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Meat_alternative_main.png","hash":"small_Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":238,"size":266.04,"path":null,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/small_Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5.png"}},"hash":"Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":200.13,"url":"https://tastewise-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Meat_alternative_main_6d0fcb92e5.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:04.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:39:04.000Z"}},{"id":17,"title":"The Sparkling Rise of Functional Beverages","how_long_to_read":"2 Min Read","author":"Meirav Perelmutter","date":"2018-09-22T09:00:00.000Z","description":"Consumers want more from their drinks, and they’re looking at functional beverages as a way to reach their health and wellness goals.

Here are three insights into the beverage ecosystem as we head into 2020.\n\n \n\n**Energy, gut health, and antioxidant top the functional drinks charts**\n\nThere is increasing interest in beverages with ingredients that can promote, protect and recover health in specific categories. Energy, gut health, and antioxidant wellness top the charts for trending functions, driving growth of drinks that offer targeted benefits in each category. Over the next five years, the functional beverage industry is forecasted to grow at an annual rate of over 8.5%. \n\n \n\n**Consumer choices are driven by an ongoing mentality switch.**\n \nConsumer tastes are changing and becoming increasingly health-oriented; reports show that consumers prefer drinks that serve a functional purpose over fruit juices and carbonated drinks. This change in preferences reflects a larger consumer inclination toward non-alcoholic beverages and the general popularity of functional beverages that highlight hardworking health ingredients like kombucha, matcha, turmeric, etc. \n\n \n\n**Collaborations between beverages and CBD brands are a big deal.**\n\nCross-industry brand partnerships are nothing new; F&B companies have been developing relationships with hospitality, fashion, and exercise brands (and more!) for years. However, the sustained boom of the CBD industry has produced innovative, interesting collaborations with F&B brands. It has become standard to see new, CBD infused products at the grocery store; from cold brew coffee (up 150% in social mentions this year) to tea (up 271%) to fruit water (up 191%), beverages are benefitting from the addition of the relaxation-inducing compound. \n\nThe trend is starting to capture the functional beverages market, too. New collaborations include CBD brands and functional health drinks like kombucha, that cater to consumers interested in promoting gut health from multiple angles.
